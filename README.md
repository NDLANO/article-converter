## API documentation

Article converter is an api for getting a extended html version of the content attribute provided by [Article API](https://github.com/NDLANO/article-api). The service has two endpoints:

**/article-converter/json/:lang/:articleId**

_Returns an extended and transformed json structure based on the one provided by [Article API](https://github.com/NDLANO/article-api)_

**/article-converter/html/:lang/:articleId**

_Returns the content attribute from [Article API](https://github.com/NDLANO/article-api) transformed to plain html and wrapped in a HTML document (useful for testing)_

The service mainly converts `<embed>` tags in the content attribute to appropriate html tags. For some embed tags fetching additional data from other api's is required.

### Developer notes

To properly display the converted html some script from [ndla-article-scripts](https://github.com/NDLANO/frontend-packages/tree/master/packages/ndla-article-scripts) is required. See [ndla-frontend](https://github.com/NDLANO/ndla-frontend) for examples.
